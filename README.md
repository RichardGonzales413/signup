## IMPORTANT
Apparently you can't upload files with the same name so some files will have "#" at the beginning in order to seperate them. For example, CommonScreens.xml will have another file somewhere else called #CommonScreens.xml
If there's a better way to organize that please let me know because adding # is quite annoying and could lead to mistakes.
