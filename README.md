I've edited about 6 files in total. They're all in the Listing folder. We currently have a functioning "create product" page. Following the instructions in the documentation allows you to create a product, however it doesn't have a "Product Type Id" because it was giving errors. I could try to fix that later on but currently it's removed, but still works.
