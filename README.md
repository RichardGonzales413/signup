I've edited about 6 files in total. They're all in the Listing folder. We currently have a functioning "create product" page. Following the instructions in the documentation allows you to create a product, however it doesn't have a "Product Type Id" because it was giving errors. I could try to fix that later on but currently it's removed, but still works. Also, if you decide to try checking it out, you don't have to call it "listing". The name is optional, however, you would also have to rename all the file dependencies since they're using the "Listing" name. I'll work on changing the name later on but we're stuck with "listing" for now.
